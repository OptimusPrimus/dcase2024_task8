## A Shared Audioâ€“Language Embedding Space for Audio Retrieval

DISCLAIMER: Work in progress

This repository contains the code to our submission to the DCASE Workshop & Challenge 2024.


## Demo!


## Use our pre-trained model



## Train your own classifier


### Setting up the environment
Create environment:
- `conda env create -f environment.yml`
- `CFLAGS='-O3 -march=native' pip install https://github.com/f0k/minimp3py/archive/master.zip`

### Download the datasets

The default directory for datasets is `~/shared`. Change this by setting `directories.data_dir` to the folder that contains the datasets.
